They’ve all been closed while they undergo expansions and renovations, and they’re all slated to return next year. The New Museum’s expansion, which adds 60,000 square feet to its existing structure, may be the biggest of these renewed institutions, but the Studio Museum is the starriest. Set to open in the fall, the Studio Museum’s 82,000-square-foot new building is set to dramatically raise the profile of this trailblazing institution, which has fostered generations of Black artists.', 'Alex Greenberger', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Building_ExteriorFacade2_072024_AlbertVecerka.jpg?w=1200', 'January 2, 2025 10:00am'),

This year, works by Henri Matisse, Robert Capa, and Frida Kahlo lose their copyright protections, as do novels like Ernest Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms and William Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury. The comics characters of Popeye and Tintin are also entering the public domain alongside those works. The UK-based organization Public Domain Review and Duke University’s Center for the Public Domain each published lists of works entering the public domain this week, the former with an advent-style calendar. In the US, UK, and some European countries, works of single authorship generally retain copyright protections for the life of the author plus 70 years. However, according to the Center for the Public Domain, in the US, those protections are only guaranteed if the work in question was not otherwise registered with the copyright office or published with a copyright notice. Due to the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act, works published or registered before 1978 receive a 95-year term of copyright. (Many other countries, in Asia and Africa and parts of the European Union, have a “life plus 50 years” terms for copyright.) Works by Matisse, Capa, and Kahlo are entering the public domain because those artists all died in 1954. Meanwhile, A Farewell to Arms and The Sound and the Fury are shedding copyright protection because they were published over 95 years ago, in 1929. Similarly, Tintin and Popeye enter the public domain because Hergé and E. C. Segar first published works involving those characters in 1929. Still, as the Center fo the Public Domain outlines, determining copyright protections for individual works of visual art is particularly tricky, given the sometimes conflicting creation and publication dates that are available. Finding a definitive answer requires consulting art historians and combing through catalogues and magazines of the era, as the organization demonstrates in this blog post, using René Magritte’s The Treachery of Images as an example. All of which is to say, best to do some legal research before starting your global Matisse cut-out T-shirt business.', 'Harrison Jacobs', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-3239925-e1735851674807.jpg', 'January 2, 2025 4:11pm'),

The budget is between £23 million–£46 million—paid for using public funds. The first of the competition’s two phases launched in December and closes January 20. Five shortlisted competitors will then battle it out during a ten-week design stage, with the winner announced next summer. Such a staggering budget may seem to befit the late queen, a towering figure of British history, but why is so much money being thrown at this statue when the country is still gripped by austerity? Almost all sectors, especially the culture sector, are in dire straits. Ministers have slashed the UK’s art and culture budget in recent years. Since 2017 alone, local government funding in England has fallen by 48 percent. Those cuts have already had material consequences. Take the case of Suffolk county in eastern England, for example; at the start 2024, its council announced its intention to completely halt funding arts culture programs, a move that could severely impact spaces such as Thomas Gainsborough’s house in Sudsbury. Is it fair that millions of pounds are now earmarked for a statue of a dead monarch when many art institutions across the UK are struggling to survive? I wrote Sandy Nairne, the former director of London’s National Portrait Gallery and a member of the Queen Elizabeth II statue’s jury, to ask. He forwarded my question to the UK government’s press office, which said, “As a national memorial to the country’s longest-serving and much-respected Monarch, the Government has identified a provisional construction budget. This is a guide for designers to develop proposals. All submissions will be judged against a number of criteria including value for money.”', 'George Nelson', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-618569182.jpg', 'January 2, 2025 3:44pm'),

Even though 2025 will be without a Whitney Biennial or a Venice Biennale, the year isn’t likely to be any quieter than last. As Senior Editor Alex Greenberger wrote in his preview of the year, 2025 is beset with new biennials on multiple continents and high-profile museum openings. And that’s without getting into how the prospective policies of the incoming Trump administration, which might affect an already tenuous economy and slowly recovering art market. If the market woes of 2024 continue, expect 2025 to winnow the field of art fairs, auction houses, and galleries. Lest we forget, the art world has expanded greatly in the last decade. This year will likely decide how much of that new infrastructure the market can actually support. Below, we asked a roster of art world insiders to give us their view of what’s coming in 2025, both in the US and abroad. Alex Glauber, art adviser and president of the Association of Professional Art Advisors: The outlook for 2025 is largely optimistic, but tinged with increasing ambivalence. Republican administrations typically have a binary effect on the art world. While the policies have historically done little to foster or support cultural development, the greatest beneficiary of their fiscal policies tend to be wealthy individuals who are the lifeblood of the market. With greater clarity and confidence on where the market stands at the end of 2024, there should be increased demand and participation among collectors in 2025. The ambivalence stems from a slew of policy variables such as interest rates, tariffs, and taxes that are all the more unpredictable given the mercurial nature of the next president. Gabriela Palmieri, founder of Palmieri Fine Art and former Sotheby’s chairman of Contemporary art, Americas: There’s a comfort and a security that come with great trophies, regardless of if they are Old Masters, Picassos, or Basquiats. But when you look closely at the overall breadth of works that came to auction in 2024, you get the impression that there are some markets that are going to be revisited in 2025. Don’t call it a comeback, but perhaps it wouldn’t be shocking for the market to realize how relatively inexpensive great examples by Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, and Ellsworth Kelly feel in addition to other great Minimalist and conceptual artists. Maybe we’ll see Christopher Wool’s market come back in a meaningful way, because there is a major delta between auction results and private sales. Collectors, I believe, will keep a tighter focus on what interests them. Due to the amount of auctions, fairs, and overall market speculation, the savviest collectors have had to adapt and say, “I’m not going to look at ten lots, l’m going to look at two.” I believe the smartest collectors, however, will realize the conversation is due for a change. It’s no longer going to just be about who else bought a work, or for how much, but hopefully there will be a deeper conversation about the art itself.', 'The Editors Of Art News', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/timesquareball.jpg', 'January 2, 2025 2:29pm'),

Murakami and Pietro Beccari, chairman and chief executive officer of Louis Vuitton, spoke with WWD about reuniting more than two decades after the launch of the line that set the mold for collaborations between artists and luxury brands. “Young people are reviving that era, and we want to connect with them through this re-release,” Beccari said in an exclusive interview conducted via email. The Louis Vuitton x Murakami collection is set to roll out next week with pop-up activations in seven cities worldwide that include experiences such as cafés, cinemas, care stations and vending machines where clients who purchase a piece from the collection can win gifts like stickers, Tamagotchi or trading cards. In Milan, the French luxury brand will take over two trams, one with a café and one with a cinema screening remastered versions of the artist’s original “Superflat Monogram” and “Superflat First Love” short films, released in 2003 and 2009, respectively.

(6, 'Hidden Medieval Wall Paintings Have Been Digitally Restored in France', 'French Medieval wall paintings hidden for more than 500 years in the Angers cathedral have been digitally restored, according to the Hamilton Kerr Institute Bulletin. The late 13th century paintings were whitewashed following a mid 15th-century fire at the cathedral and subsequently boxed behind woodwork by 1786, which protected them from iconoclasts and vandalization during the French Revolution. In 1980, they were found by a priest who had been using the small area for storage. Though French experts restored the work, they had previously only been recorded in partial black and white images. The vibrant paintings depict the life and miracles of Saint Maurille, a bishop of Angers during the fifth-century whose relics were once housed in a silver shrine within the cathedral. Legend has it that Saint Maurille failed to raise a child from the dead and, as a result, fled to England where he penitentially worked for the king as a gardener. Saint Maurille later learned that the child was in fact alive and he returned to the site of the cathedral to bless the boy, who became Saint René. The paintings are still concealed behind wall panelling, which forms part of the choir loft. As such, it took a team of UK–based art historians and conservators more than a decade to fully capture an image of the wall painting, which was digitally constructed through the combination of more than 8,000 photographs of the curving walls.The Angers region was home to the Plantagenets who ruled England for centuries. The paintings may have been commissioned by Isabella la Blanche, half sister of the English king Henry III, or her son Maurice. The team believes the paintings were made by two groups of painters using oil, and note similarities between the rendering of a young king in the banquet painting and the portrait sculpture of Henry III on his tomb in London’s Westminster Abbey. These similarities, combined with the narrative of cross-Channel travel between the English and French, they believe, are not coincidental. There appears to be a shared knowledge among the painters of material use and styling that may be connected to those of Henry III’s court.', 'Francesca Aton', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-03-at-12.46.45%E2%80%AFPM.png', 'January 3, 2025 1:17pm'),

These galleries, in chronological and thematic order, feature a selection of the collection’s 15,000 artifacts as the museum fine-tunes its operations ahead of what hopefully will soon be its—no pun intended—grand opening. Originally announced in 2002, the GEM has long been heralded as a symbol of Egypt‘s future, as part of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi’s Egypt Vision 2030, a large portion of which involves a major redevelopment of the Giza plateau, where GEM—and the famous Pyramids of Giza—is located. The challenge for the museum’s designers, Dublin-based Heneghan Peng Architects, was to honor ancient Egyptian history, known for its ancient innovations and luxury and long a draw for foreign tourists, while positioning modern Egypt in a similar light.This balance between old and new starts at the entrance. There, visitors are immediately greeted by a 3,000-year-old statue of Ramses the Great, the legendary ruler of Egypt’s Nineteenth Dynasty. Carved from granite, the statue was discovered in fragments and endured several unsuccessful restoration attempts before it was placed in Cairo’s Ramses Square. Exposed to pollution and the vibrations of nearby traffic, the statue’s preservation was at risk.

And that this was meant to help her slowly get over the loss of said doll?I, for one, did not. It’s a story mentioned briefly on a wall text at the Morgan Library’s new exhibition in lovely tribute to Franz Kafka, on view through April 13. And reader, it knocked me out. Internet sleuths, of course, don’t believe it actually happened. Dora Diamant, Kafka’s partner for the last year of his baroquely sad life, claimed it did, and said she saw the strange, pathetic comedy unfold before her own eyes.One day, in Berlin, the lovers came upon a despondent girl from their neighborhood (Steiglitz), weeping in a park. When pressed, the girl said that she had lost her doll. Diamant and Kafka combed the park for it to no avail. Then, that very night, Kafka apparently set to work on a special project: a brief literary correspondence to the girl, in which he took on the guise of the doll, writing from afar and explaining that it, the doll, had many special adventures it had to attend to. As Diamant recalled in the early 1950s to Marthe Robert, a French translator of Kafka, Kafka feverishly wrote a veritable novella to the girl over the span of about three weeks, narrating the doll’s life from the first person: it grew up, it went to school, it met people.', 'Carlos Valladares', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kafka_Installation_5.jpg', 'January 3, 2025 5:00am'),

Together, they joked “maybe we met in the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.”That infamous 1911 disaster in Greenwich Village took the lives of 146 garment workers—123 of them women, and many, adolescents, some as young as 14. The workshop produced shirtwaists, Edwardian-style women’s blouses that were, by then, going out of style. The fire’s death toll was so high because, when it broke out, on a Saturday, before the workers’ one-day weekend, the doors to stairwells and exits were locked, a practice intended to reduce theft, prevent workers from taking breaks, and keep union organizers out. The factory owners survived, scurrying from their roof to another one nearby and leaving behind their staff, whom they paid as little as five dollars an hour in today’s currency to work 52-hour weeks.

Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Center, Los Angeles For more than three decades, María Magdalena Campos-Pons has used her body as a vessel in performances, photographs, sculptural installations, collages, and videos. A 2023 winner of the MacArthur “genius” fellowship, the artist has variously addressed motherhood, her family’s transnational heritage, and the hidden histories all around her, using objects and sites in her home country of Cuba to speak to painful generational memories of enslavement that linger on today. Across her multifarious body of work, she shows how the past is embedded in us, the people we hold dear, and the objects we collect.Spoken Softly with Mama (1998), an installation originally staged for the Museum of Modern Art, crystallizes many of Campos-Pons’s thematic concerns across the years. In this installation, which she made with the jazz musician Neil Leonard, Campos-Pons enlists video of herself, photographic blow-ups of her family members, ironing boards, and irons to pay homage to the long history of Black women serving as domestic workers, roles that have their precedents in slavery. She upholds that history, which has often been made invisible, and turns this space into something like an altar.

Soil, hay, cinnamon, and cloves recur in these transportive pieces, which are variously intended to communicate cosmovisions and channel altered states. Often monumental in size and spare in their aesthetic, her sculptures recall Minimalist art of the 1960s and ’70s, though they also draw directly from the knowledge and aesthetics of Indigenous Amazonian cultures.All of this made Morelos a natural fit for the Dia Art Foundation, which began as a haven for Minimalist and Conceptualist art five decades ago. In recent years, Dia director Jessica Morgan has made it one of her stated goals to diversify the foundation’s offerings, to account for forms of Minimalism beyond the ones already ensconced in the Western canon. Morelos, who was born in the Colombian town of Tierralta and is now based in the capital city of Bogotá, responded to the Minimalism already abundant in Dia’s collection, cleverly repositioning the cold industrial-grade forms in art by Richard Serra, Robert Morris, Walter De Maria, and more. De Maria’s New York Earth Room (1977) was one of the primary reference points for the two works on view, El abrazo and Cielo terrenal (both 2023). The latter work consisted of black clay sourced from the Hudson Valley, which she painted onto the walls and floor of the museum; discarded objects from past Dia shows also figured here. Plunged into near darkness, viewers were presented with an excavation site of sorts. El abrazo, meanwhile, consisted of a towering mound of recycled soil mixed with hay and coir.

Through an interest in theater, he discovered dance by the likes of Merce Cunningham, Trisha Brown, and Meredith Monk. He recalled seeing Monk’s Quarry: an opera in three movements (1976) and being completely “in wonderment of the body” and the “totality of her idea of performance.” Lemon followed Monk around in 1978 to experience her performances and joined a workshop with her, after which she invited him to move to New York and join her company.Born in 1952, Lemon rose to prominence in the ’80s downtown scene as founder of the Ralph Lemon Dance Company, creating works like Joy (1990), set to a score composed by John Cale. He disbanded the company in 1995 and, over the course of some 10 years, developed what would become the Geography Trilogy (1996–2004), which explored his research into the cultures of Africa, Asia, and the American South, and their various traditions of dance and movement. The work took the form of movement-based multimedia pieces; part three, Come home Charley Patton, involved close collaboration with Walter Carter, a former Mississippi sharecropper with whom Lemon worked until Carter’s death in 2002.Lemon exhibited hundreds of drawings in the 2022 Whitney Biennial, in a presentation that rotated during the exhibition’s run.

The Cubists’ kaleidoscopic unmooring of geometry from perspectival propriety inspired Orphism’s drive toward “pure painting”—pictorial form and color liberated from figurative duties—but, confusingly enough, the movement’s name is bound up with literary allusion. Coined in 1912 by French poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire, it evokes Orpheus, the mythical Greek prophet and musician. For Apollinaire, music suggested a new model for modern painting distilled to its purest potential state, unbeholden to narrative exposition. Though developed almost exclusively in Paris, Orphism involved artists of wide-ranging extraction and nationality, and the Orphic painters’ concern for “pure” form and color resonated with other developments in nonobjective painting from Germany to Italy to the United States. “Harmony and Dissonance: Orphism in Paris, 1910–1930” goes a long way in contextualizing some of those parallels and intersections. Enlivened by an impressive array of loans, the exhibition sets into relief Orphism’s specific aesthetic achievements as well as its amorphous taxonomy.As the wall text notes, the painters most closely affiliated with Orphism—Robert and Sonia Delaunay, Francis Picabia, and František Kupka—never adapted Apollinaire’s term of designation as their own. They produced no manifesto or writing in its name, and the Delaunays, for their part, used the term “simultanism” to describe their work. But formal ambitions and optical effects undeniably united a few artists of disparate origins and diverging aesthetic trajectories, even if briefly.', 'Ara H.

Lijn was 19 years old when she arrived on the scene, so few in the cafés really listened to her ideas. Still, there was lots to absorb. Lijn would eventually become known for her kinetic sculptures and works traversing science and art, but everything she made for the next half-century owed to her brushes with Surrealism.

I think I ate that banana in 2019, and look how far we’ve come: This year’s blockbuster, the Lego movie, itself basically an ad for Lego, is also a biopic of Pharrell Williams, the rapper who is also the creative director for Louis Vuitton. Where does the culture end and the ad begin? They don’t want you to know. When a Frozen or Pharrell-type phenom emerges, brands will work to find a way to capitalize on the attention they attract. In the art world, the crossovers are mostly happening between artists and luxury fashion, since both realms attract wealthy clientele. When these fashion collaborations began taking over the art world, around the time of the banana ad, I was optimistic: fashion money sure beats the nefarious sources of wealth routed through art’s opaque market. And together, artists and brands were making cool stuff, like that Anna Uddenberg sculpture for Balenciaga, and the photos Tyler Mitchell took for Ferragamo in the Uffizi.But then, it started to feel as if art and marketing were beginning to collapse into one thing.

The potential dangers range from art forgery to identity fraud to political disinformation. The message is clear: images can mislead, and the stakes are high. You should learn to detect the real from the fake.Or should you? The most recent headline grabber is an instructive case in point.

To mark British Mother’s Day, Kensington Palace released a photo of Middleton with her three children, the first photograph of her to be published since she had surgery in January. Major news agencies like the Associated Press promptly killed the photograph, citing anomalies that cast doubt on its authenticity. Rumors exploded, and Middleton subsequently issued an apology, claiming responsibility for the bad Photoshop job before announcing the reason behind her desire to conceal: the princess has cancer. Before all this was clarified, journalists identified the characteristic tells of a manipulated, or outright fabricated, image in the Middleton photo. Their close attention to these attributes is not unlike how I, as an art historian, examine a painting.

(17, 'Why Climate Protesters Should Keep Targeting Museums', 'ON FEBRUARY 28, 1974, Tony Shafrazi walked into the Museum of Modern Art in New York and spray-painted kill lies all in red across the achromatic surface of Picasso’s Guernica (1937), in protest of United States atrocities in Vietnam. The next day, his action appeared on the front page of the New York Times, as he had intended: Shafrazi had notified news agencies in advance. On October 14, 2022, nearly 50 years later, Phoebe Plummer and Anna Holland walked into the National Gallery in London, opened a can of tomato soup, and splattered it across glass protecting Van Gogh’s Sunflowers (1889). The duo then smeared superglue on their palms before affixing them to the wall below the work. Plummer, whose voice was quivering with emotion, demanded: “What is worth more? Art or life?” The gesture, planned by the activist group Just Stop Oil, was a call to arms against the fossil fuel industry. The action immediately went viral. News reports invariably called it—as well as similar subsequent interventions—an “attack.” Museums, one after another, have continually condemned the “endangerment” of artworks, while being careful not to denounce the activists’ politics. As climate protests in museums have proliferated, debates have focused on the “cost” of these actions, while ignoring the urgency of the activists’ appeals. Similarly, the Times called Shafrazi a “vandal,” but made no direct mention of Vietnam. If these truly were attacks, the injuries sustained by the artworks were ephemeral. MoMA conservators scrubbed the spray paint from Guernica’s varnished surface by the end of the day. The National Gallery cleaned and rehung Sunflowers within six hours. The climate activists deliberately targeted the work’s protective glass and frame, not the painting itself. Materially, this doesn’t constitute an attack on the artwork at all; rather, both gestures are political performances that operate primarily within the symbolic sphere.', 'Michael Wang', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMAGE_JustStopOil_NationalGallery5_14102022.png', 'November 16, 2023 10:47am'),
(18, 'The Supreme Court’s Warhol Decision Just Changed the Future of Art', 'For close to 30 years—up until last week—courts have wrestled with the question of when artists can borrow from previous works by focusing in large part on whether the new work was “transformative”: whether it altered the first with “new expression, meaning or message” (in the words of a 1994 Supreme Court decision). In blockbuster case after blockbuster case involving major artists such as Jeff Koons and Richard Prince, lower courts repeatedly asked that question, even if they often reached disparate results. But in a major decision last week involving Andy Warhol, the Supreme Court pushed this pillar of copyright law to the background. Instead, the Court shifted the consideration away from the artistic contribution of the new work, and focused instead on commercial concerns. By doing so, the Court’s Warhol decision will significantly limit the amount of borrowing from and building on previous works that artists can engage in.The case involved 16 works Andy Warhol had created based on a copyrighted photograph taken in 1981 by celebrated rock and roll photographer Lynn Goldsmith of the musician Prince. While Goldsmith had disputed Warhol’s right to create these works, and by implication the rights of museums and collectors to display or sell them, the Supreme Court decided the case on a much narrower issue. When Prince died in 2016, the Warhol Foundation (now standing in the artist’s shoes) had licensed one of Warhol’s silkscreens for the cover of a special Condé Nast magazine commemorating the musician. Explicitly expressing no opinion on the question of whether Warhol had been entitled to create the works in the first place, the Court ruled 7-2 that this specific licensing of the image was unlikely to be “fair use” under copyright law.', 'Amy Adler', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AndyWarhol_London_1971.jpeg', 'May 26, 2023 10:47am'),
(19, 'George Washington Carver Exhibition Looks at How a Scientific Genius Still Influences Artists Today', 'Historically, the relationship between Black Americans and the American South—in both the art world and the world writ large—is reduced to that of oppression and enslavement, with little attention paid to the creative and scientific innovations that both preceded and followed emancipation. The California African American Museum in Los Angeles hopes to change that limited understanding with its current exhibition, “World Without End: The George Washington Carver Project” (on view through March 2), which opened this fall as part of the Getty Foundation’s PST ART exhibition initiative. The show gives George Washington Carver his long-overdue flowers, not just for his scientific prowess but also for his less celebrated work as an artist. Cocurated by CAAM executive director Cameron Shaw and independent curator Yael Lipschutz, the show aims to illustrate how Carver’s creative thinking fueled his technological advancements.Carver, an innovative scientist and educator who was born into slavery, was renowned in the early 20th century for his myriad agricultural inventions—often left unpatented by the self-proclaimed “people’s scientist” by design. Carver’s pioneering plant-based approaches to medicine and engineering, which privileged sustainability over profit, were ahead of their time, as were his applications of peanuts and sweet potatoes, organic fertilizers, clay-derived dyes, and crop rotation, now heralded as foundations of modern farming and conservation practices.To realize the exhibition, Lipschutz and Shaw paired archival material related to Carver’s scientific legacy with works by contemporary artists. Lipschutz had conceived of this approach well before the Getty announced “Art & Science Collide” as the theme for this year’s PST ART, in an effort to “demonstrate how revolutionary and ahead of his time George Washington Carver was,” Shaw said. When Lipschutz brought the idea to CAAM, Shaw said yes because it “epitomized CAAM’s mission in our shared focus on African-American history and contemporary art.”', 'Evan Nicole Brown', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/CAAM_09.23.241876.jpg', 'December 20, 2024 6:00am'),
(21, 'Janet Olivia Henry’s Dark and Playful Sculptures Made of Toys Are Gaining Widespread Recognition', 'Do you want a plastic shopping cart small enough to be pushed around by a doll? Go right ahead, and Google it—you’ll turn up many carts of that kind. But not so long ago, it wasn’t so easy to find objects like this on demand, the artist Janet Olivia Henry pointed out recently. She can still recall the thrill of the chase that she felt while shuttling around Manhattan several decades ago, looking for toys to be used in her sculptures. During the ’70s, Henry began making her “Juju Boxes,” assortments of toys of all kinds—troll dolls, tiny plastic sinks and pails, little bottles, mini mattresses, and more. Thinking of the West African practice of creating containers filled with spiritual potential, Henry spent her spare time traversing New York, trawling the stands of street vendors and the aisles of toy stores alike. “I could walk across town to Chinatown with $10, and I would come back with a big bag of all these things,” she said.Eventually, she began creating “Juju Bags,” for which she shot pictures of the toys she “accumulated”—not acquired, she was quick to note—and placed the printed images in plastic sacks stuffed with shredded dollars, papers, and more. Strung up like gigantic necklaces, these sacks collectively stand in for characters of Henry’s making, including one that she named White Protestant Male. “When I did White Protestant Male,” she said, using a shorthand for one of the “Juju Bags,” “I found that American culture has been replicated in miniature.” In 1994, when she gave that bag a counterpart for a character named Mrs. White Protestant Male, she made sure to find a little plastic cart, which Henry considered the ultimate symbol of bourgeois femininity. Failing to locate it in the FAO Schwartz under the World Trade Center, Henry later visited a Spanish grocery store, where she found her cart and purchased it on sight.', 'Alex Greenberge', 'https://www.artnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/LEAD-IMG_241111_Janet-Olivia-Henry_Gordon-Robichaux_0057.jpg', 'December 18, 2024 10:00am');
